-->Driver initialization is done at test case level(can use driverFactory model for code reusablity)
-->Driver methods can be moved to driverFactory and tests should inherit those properties
-->WebElements are initialized differntly in the three tests(can use POM model for a better design)
-->HardCodings can be removed according to usability
-->Driver Path should be set before driver initialization
